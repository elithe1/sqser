# Substring block list Filter Plugin

This filter is used to specify which sub strings should be filtered out and not to be returned to the caller. It is used
if we have some dev queues that are not really getting empty or we don't care about them that much.

## Configuration

values will have the list of strings that can not be in the names of the queues to be returned.
